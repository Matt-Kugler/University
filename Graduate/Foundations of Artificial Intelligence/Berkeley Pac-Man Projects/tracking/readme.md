This was the final [pacman project from Berekely](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/project4/) that we implemented. In this project I designed pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts efficiently. Inference was implemented to find the ghosts that need to be eaten. A distance sensor was utilized to determine how far pacman is from a ghost using a crude distance measurement. Given an observation from pacman's sensors, the agent belief distribution over ghost poistions was updated. A simple Bayesian network was also implemented to track multiple ghosts simulataneously via a particle filter as part of this project. I received full marks for this project according to running submission_autograder.py.
