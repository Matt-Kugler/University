This was the [first project](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/project1/) associated with the pacman assignments. In this project I built general search algorithms to allow pacman to optimally find food in a maze with walls. Depth First search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search were implemented for this problem as well as practice with Heuristics. I received full marks for this project submission according to running submission_autograder.py.
