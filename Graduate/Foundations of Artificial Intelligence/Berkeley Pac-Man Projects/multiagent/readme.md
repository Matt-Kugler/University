This is my implementation of the [second pacman project](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/project2/) from Berkely. This project had me design agents for pacman including the ghost characcters. Minimax and Expectimax search was implemented as well as evaluation function design. The designed agents for this project had to consider both food locations and ghost locations to perform the search optimally. Alpha-Beta pruning was also implemented for this project. I received full marks for this project according to running submission_autograder.py.
