A collection of my projects completed during my Undergraduate degree at NU.

## BridgIt.java
#### The game begins, both players alternate turns trying to build a bridge to their other side. Also contains a timer to track game duration.

## FloodIt.java
#### A size customizable board is generated. The player must "Flood" the board by selecting colors that will cause a cascading effect to fill the board from the top left corner. There is a limit on the amount of moves allowed based on the board size and amount of colors generated. The player wins if they fill the board with one color before running out of moves. A timer tracks game duration.

## Fishy.java
#### The initial board is generated with a player controlled red "Fish". Randomly generated blue "Fish" move from each side of the screen and the player must "eat" the smaller fish to grow larger. If the player tries to "eat" a larger fish, the game ends with a loss. If the player becomes larger than the largest fish that can be generated, the player wins.
